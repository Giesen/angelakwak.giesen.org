Uh, I think so. Yeah, it's 8:00. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Ahh. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Doc, you gotta help- I guarantee it.

Precisely. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Oh. Yeah, exactly. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. I'm gonna be at the dance. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.

I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Leave me alone. Lorraine, are you up there?

No. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Because, you might regret it later in life.
